# Bird City
https://travis1282.github.io/Bird-City/

## What it is 
This is a simple game where a player can steer a flock of birds through a simple city landscape using the "W", "A", "S", "D", keys. The object of the game is to eat as many bugs as you can in 2 minutes while avoiding the buildings. Birds are removed from your flock when they collide with the buildings making it more difficult to eat the bugs. 

## What's it made of?
This is written in vanilla javascript using the using THREE.js rendering library 

## What's the plan
This was a fun experiment to help me learn THREE.js. It's a great library and I will definitely use it again however I've discovered Babylon.js and would use it for any future games because of it's built in collision detection among other rendering advantages for gaming. 

## Future goals
I would like the flight pattern of the birds to be a bit more natural, currently they mostly flock in a ball and I would prefer a more organic blob that changes shape with flight direction. I was toying with progressive loading of the buildings and bugs, which would be a better answer than the current "load enough so it's hard to find the end" solution.
